Pods are ephemeral and stateless.
Volumes bring persistence to pods.
Containers has access to volume with in a same pod.
If node stops working, the pod can be rescheduled on another node and the volume can be attached to the new node.
It support many types of Storages.

[Ephemeral Volumes]
Ephemeral Volumes is a temporary space.
Ephemeral Volumes in the sense that it is cleaned up when the workload is deleted or the container crashes.
There are many types of Ephemeral Volumes.
● emptyDir
The emptyDir are provided as local ephemeral storage. They are managed by kubelet on each node.
● configMap, downwardAPI, secret
It inject different kinds of Kubernetes data into a Pod.
The configMap, downwardAPI, secret are provided as local ephemeral storage. They are managed by kubelet on each node.
● CSI ephemeral volumes
It provided by special CSI drivers.
CSI ephemeral volumes must be provided by third-party CSI storage drivers.
● generic ephemeral volumes
It can be provided by all storage drivers that also support persistent volumes.
Generic ephemeral volumes can be provided by third-party CSI storage drivers, but also by any other storage driver that supports dynamic provisioning.
Some CSI drivers are written specifically for CSI ephemeral volumes and do not support dynamic provisioning: those then cannot be used for generic ephemeral volumes.

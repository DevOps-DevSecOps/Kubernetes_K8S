A Kubernetes cluster has a limited amount of available hardware resources.
Hardware resources are measured based on worker nodes with a specific number of CPU cores or RAM allocation.
For every Pod in the namespace, each container must have a memory request, memory limit, cpu request, and cpu limit.
By default there is no limit on how much resource a pod and its container can consume.
Requests and Limits are the mechanism used by kubernetes to control CPU and Memory consumed by containers in pod.
Requests and Limits are set on a per container basis.
ResourceQuotas can also be set for Kubernetes Objects with in a Namespaces.

RBAC could be a security style that restricts access to valuable resources.

Role and RoleBinding to scope security to a single namespace.
Role and RoleBinding are used in namespaced scoped.

ClusterRole and RoleBinding are used provide access to more than one namespace or the whole cluster.

ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding to scope security to all namespaces OR cluster-scoped resources.

Verbs
● watch
● list
● get
● create
● update
● patch
● delete

Subjects
● Users
These are global, and meant for humans or processes living outside the cluster.
● Groups
Set of users.
● Service Accounts
Kubernetes uses service accounts to authenticate and authorize requests by pods to the Kubernetes API server.

[Role]
Role are applicable within a namespace.
Role are namespaced, meaning Roles work within the constraints of a namespace.
After creating a Role, assign it to a user or group of users by creating a RoleBinding.
After creating a Role, have to bind them to either RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding.
If a namespaced grouping of resources and allowed operations that can assign to a user or a group of users using a RoleBinding.
It defines that will do to a group of resources.
It used to assigning resources for a namespace.

[RoleBinding]
RoleBinding holds a list of subjects (users, groups, or service accounts) and a reference to the Role being granted.
RoleBinding grants permissions within a specific namespace.
RoleBinding may reference any Role in the same namespace.
It assign a Role or a ClusterRole to a user or a group within a specific namespace.
It is used for granting permission to a Subject in a Kubernetes cluster. Subjects are nothing but a user, service, or a group.

[ClusterRole]
ClusterRole are applicable across cluster-wide.
ClusterRole give access across more than one namespace or all namespaces.
After creating a ClusterRole, you assign it to a user or group of users by creating a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding.
ClusterRoles are typically used with service accounts.
Its a cluster-level grouping of resources and allowed operations that can assign to a user or a group using a RoleBinding or a ClusterRoleBinding.
It used to assign resources on a cluster level, need to use ClusterRole.
The default ClusterRole are
● cluster-admin
Cluster wide super user.
● admin
Full access within a Namespace.
● edit
Read/write within a Namespace.
● view
Read-only within a Namespace.

[ClusterRoleBinding]
ClusterRoleBinding grants access cluster-wide and to multiple namespaces.
ClusterRoleBinding is binding or associating a ClusterRole with a Subject (users, groups, or service accounts).
It assign a ClusterRole to a user or a group for all namespaces in the cluster.
It is used to grant permission to a subject on a cluster-level in all the namespaces.

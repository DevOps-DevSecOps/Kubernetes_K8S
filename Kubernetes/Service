[hostPort]
The hostPort setting applies to the Kubernetes containers.
The container port will be exposed to the external network at <hostIP>:<hostPort>, where the hostIP is the IP address of the Kubernetes node where the container is running and the hostPort is the port requested by the user.
The hostPort feature allows to expose a single container port on the host IP.
Using the hostPort to expose an application to the outside of the Kubernetes cluster.
The host IP can change when the container is restarted, two containers using the same hostPort cannot be scheduled on the same node.

[hostNetwork]
When a pod is configured with "hostNetwork: true", the applications running in such a pod can directly see the network interfaces of the host machine where the pod was started.
An application that is configured to listen on all network interfaces will in turn be accessible on all network interfaces of the host machine.
The every time the pod is restarted Kubernetes can reschedule the pod onto a different node and so the application will change its IP address.
Besides that two applications requiring the same port cannot run on the same node. 
This can lead to port conflicts when the number of applications running on the cluster grows.

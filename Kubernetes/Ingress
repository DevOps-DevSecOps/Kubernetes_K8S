It manages external access to the services in a cluster.
The main features of Ingress are load balancing, name-based virtual hosting, URL routing, and SSL termination.
It exposes one or more services to external clients through a single externally reachable IP address.
Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

● Ingress Resource
It is responsible for storing DNS routing rules in the cluster.
● Ingress Controller
It is responsible for routing by accessing the DNS rules applied through Ingress Resource.
● Ingress Proxy
It route external HTTP traffic to services and their endpoints.

[Ingress Controllers]
Ingress controllers in Kubernetes are resources that accept traffic from the internet and load balance it to applications (usually in the form of running pods).
Ingress controllers abstract away the complexity of routing traffic to applications running within a Kubernetes cluster.
Ingress controller is a daemon running in a Pod that watches the /ingresses endpoint on the API server.
When a new endpoint is created, the daemon uses the configured set of rules to allow traffic into a service.
There are several types of Ingress Controllers.

An awsElasticBlockStore volume mounts an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EBS volume into pod.
It is erased when a pod is removed, the contents of an EBS volume are persisted and the volume is unmounted.
The EBS volume can be pre-populated with data, and that data can be shared between pods.
It must create an EBS volume by using an command (aws ec2 create-volume) OR the AWS API before can use it.
There are some restrictions when using an awsElasticBlockStore volume:-
● The nodes on which pods are running must be AWS EC2 instances.
● Those instances need to be in the same region and availability zone as the EBS volume.
● EBS only supports a single EC2 instance mounting a volume.

It creates empty directory first created when a Pod is assigned to a node.
It stays as long as pod is running.
Once pod is removed from a node, emptyDir is deleted forever. (OR) When a Pod is removed from a node for any reason, the data in the emptyDir is deleted permanently.
It's an temporary space.   
The emptyDir volume is initially empty. 
All containers in the Pod can read and write the same files in the emptyDir volume, though that volume can be mounted at the same or different paths in each container.

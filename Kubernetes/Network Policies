By default the Pods are non isolated, they can accept any traffic from any source.
By default, all pods in Kubernetes are non-isolated, meaning that all pods are able to talk to one another. This is true for pods in the same namespace and pods in different namespaces.
It defines how the pods in the same namespace will communicate with each other and the network endpoint.
Pods become isolated by attaching to a Network Policy.
Network Policy is attached to a Pod, that pod will reject any connections that are not allowed by any Network Policy.
Its resources use labels to select the pods and define rules to allow traffic to a specific pod in addition to which is defined in the namespace.
Let say have created a new Pod and the created a Service IP (ClusterIP, NodePort) attached to Pod, so that particular Pod accessed by any of the Pod in the cluster.

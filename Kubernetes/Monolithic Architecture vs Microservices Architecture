[Monolithic]
It built as one large system.
It is not easy to scale.
It has shared database.
Deployment of large code base makes IDE slow and build time gets increase.

[Microservices]
It built as small independent module based on functionality.
It is easy to scale.
Each project and module has their own database.
Deployment of each project is independent and small in size. So overall build and development time gets decrease.

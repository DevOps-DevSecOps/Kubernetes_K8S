StatefulSets is used for stateful applications.
StatefulSet is the Kubernetes controller used to run the stateful application as containers (Pods) in the Kubernetes cluster.
The advantage of StatefulSets are unique network identifiers, persistent storage, graceful deployment and scaling, automated rolling updates.
StatefulSets assign a sticky identity an ordinal number starting from zero to each Pod instead of assigning random IDs for each replica Pod.
The POD_NAME for Pods Workload are assigned as only POD_NAME, with out an random IDs and ordinal number. (POD_NAME)
The POD_NAME for Deployments Workload are assigned with random IDs. (POD_NAME-XXXX-XXXX)
The POD_NAME for ReplicaSet and ReplicationController Workload are assigned with random IDs. (POD_NAME-XXXX)
The POD_NAME for DaemonSet Workload are assigned with random IDs. (POD_NAME-XXXX)
The POD_NAME for StatefulSets Workload are assigned with ordinal numbers from zero to each Pod. (POD_NAME-0, POD_NAME-1, POD_NAME-2, ...., POD_NAME-NO)
Ordered numbers for each Pod.
The first Pod (POD_NAME-0) will be Primary and other Pods (POD_NAME-1 ..... POD_NAME-NO) will be Secondary.
The first Pod (POD_NAME-0) will handle both read and write requests from the user and other Pods (POD_NAME-1 ..... POD_NAME-NO) always sync with the first Pod (POD_NAME-0) for data replication.
The first Pod (POD_NAME-0) can be a primary when creating a replicated database setup which handles both reading and writing, remaining other Pods (POD_NAME-1 ..... POD_NAME-NO) act as replicas will be secondary.
If any one of the Pod dies, a new Pod is created with the same name.
New Pods will only be created if the previous Pod is in running state and will clone the previous Pod’s data.
A new Pod is created by cloning the previous Pod’s data.
If the previous Pod is in the pending state, then the new Pod will not be created.
Deletion of Pods occurs in reverse order.
# EXAMPLE:- 4 replicas Pods current running and need scaled down to 3 replicas mean that it should be run 3 Pods, it will delete the last Pod numbered 3.

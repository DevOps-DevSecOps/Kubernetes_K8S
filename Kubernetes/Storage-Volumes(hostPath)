A hostPath volume mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into Pod.
The data is persistence even after the pod is terminated.
The "type: Directory" will create the directory inside with out any parent directory.
The "type: DirectoryOrCreate" will create the parent directory.
The "type: FileOrCreate" will does not create the parent directory of the file. If the parent directory of the mounted file does not exist, the pod fails to start.

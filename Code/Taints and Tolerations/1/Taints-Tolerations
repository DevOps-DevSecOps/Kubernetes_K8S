[COMMAND]
kubectl taint nodes NODE_NAME storage=ssd:NoSchedule

[Notes]
I added the toleration for the above taint using the “Equal” operator.
I could also use the “Exists” operator, which will apply toleration to any node matching the key of the taint.
However, the value doesn’t need to be specified.
In this case, I’ll use the taint “storage=ssd: NoSchedule” to schedule the pod we define above to the node.

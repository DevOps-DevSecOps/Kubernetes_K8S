To see the status of the init container.
$ kubectl get po
NAME      READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
website   0/1     Init:0/1   0          1s
The number 0/1 indicates a total of 1 init containers, and 0 containers have been completed so far.
In case the init container fails, the status changes to Init:Error or Init:CrashLoopBackOff if the container fails repeatedly.

Can also use the logs command to get the logs from the init container by specifying the container name using the -c flag.
$ kubectl logs website -c clone-repo
Cloning into '/usr/share/nginx/html'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 6, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (6/6), done.

Finally, to actually see the static HTML page can use port-forward to forward the local port to the port 80 on the container.
$ kubectl port-forward pod/website 8000:80
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8000 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:8000 -> 80

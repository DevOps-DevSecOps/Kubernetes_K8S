● Storage
PV has 10Gi, PVC requesting 5Gi.
Once PV and PVC bounded, resource will use only requested storage, so in this case 5Gi will be waste.
It would be better to use also 5Gi in PV or 10Gi in PVC.
● AccessMode
PV and PVC has both have ReadWriteOnce.
● storageClassName
define the storageClassName as testvolume.

[Misconfiguration]
PVC is looking for PV with volumeMode: Block. 
As your current PV don't have it, it will not be bounded.

[Solution]
Then add 'volumeMode: Block' to PV configuration and PVC will bound PV.

[Tests]
As described the PV can find information for 'volumeMode' default would be "volumeMode: Filesystem".

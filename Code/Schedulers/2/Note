The "leader-elect" option is used when you have multiple copies of the scheduler running on different master nodes.
If multiple copies of the same scheduler are running on different nodes, only one can be active at a time.
That’s where the "leader-elect" option helps in choosing a leader who will lead scheduling activities.
To get multiple schedulers working, you must either set the leader-elect option to false, in case where you don’t have multiple masters.
--leader-elect=true
--scheduler-name=SCHEDULER_NAME
--lock-object-name=SCHEDULER_NAME

Verifying that the pods were scheduled using the desired schedulers
The below command to check which scheduler assigned to pod
COMMAND:- $ kubectl get events
          $ kubectl describe pod POD_NAME

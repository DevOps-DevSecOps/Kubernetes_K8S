Ephemeral Container can be used to debug a pod in either of below cases:
● If the container running inside pod doesn’t have any debugging utilities such as shell.
● If the container has crashed.
In this case, it won’t be able to exec inside shell of container to troubleshoot an issue.

[Demo with shell-less container]
1. Deploy a pod which does not have any shell utility in its container.
kubectl run ephemeral-demo --image=k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.1 --restart=never
Above command creates a pod named ephemeral-demo, using an image which doesn’t have any shell utility.
2. Try to exec inside the container.
kubectl exec -it ephemeral-demo -- bash
It should not be able to access the shell of container as their is no shell utility in the image.
3. Inject an ephemeral container to troubleshoot the pod container.
The syntax for below command:- "kubectl debug -it EXISTINGPODNAME --image=DEBUGGERIMAGENAME:TAG --target=EXISTINGCONTAINERNAME"
kubectl debug -it ephemeral-demo --image=busybox:1.28 --target=ephemeral-demo
The kubectl debug command will add an ephemeral container inside the pod and start a shell interactive session.

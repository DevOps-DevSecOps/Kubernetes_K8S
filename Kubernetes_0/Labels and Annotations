Kubernetes Labels and Kubernetes Annotations are used to add the metadata to our Kubernetes objects.

[Labels]
Kubernetes Labels are used for adding identifying metadata to Kubernetes objects.
Kubernetes Labels allow us to do a grouping of our objects so that we can perform queries for viewing and operating.
Kubernetes Labels are used within selector sections.

[Annotations]
Kubernetes Annotations are used for adding non-identifying metadata to Kubernetes objects.
This metadata information is only for the user.
Annotations can hold any kind of information that is useful and can provide context to DevOps teams.
Kubernetes Annotations canâ€™t specify selector sections.
